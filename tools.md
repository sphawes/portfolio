There are a number of tools that I love and use regularly. They're listed below!

### Computer Setup

#### 2021 14-inch MacBook Pro - `melange`

This thing is the beating heart of literally everything I do. It's never more than 6 feet away from me at any given time. I got the 16 GB variant, which has proven to be more than enough for me, despite having 15 applications open simultaneously. I do wish I had gone with the 1 TB storage option, as 512 GB fills up pretty quickly when editing video directly from my SSD.

##### [Caldigit TS3 Dock](https://amzn.to/3KoFMg0)

A single USB-C cable connects power, two monitors, and all my peripherals to my Mac. It's a bit pricey, but I frequently need to take my laptop around the office, so the ease of just plugging in a single cable is really nice.

##### [Apple Magic Trackpad](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMMP3AM/A/magic-trackpad-black-multi-touch-surface)

As much as I've tried to get used to a mouse, I am inherently a trackpad guy. I've almost exclusively used laptops my whole life, and now I have a hard time *not* using one. When docked at my home office, my Magic Trackpad gives me the same navigation experience as my standalone laptop.

##### [Sandisk 1 TB SSD](https://amzn.to/4bHV3Ez)

When the internal storage on my mac isn't quite enough to juggle the 50 GB or so that editing a Youtube video requires, I'll work off of this little dude. It's just about as fast as my interal SSD (at least, to my perception). I used to have a piece of velcro on the back of my laptop to keep it better coupled to my computer, and provide a bit of strain relief on the connector.

##### [Fifine USB Condenser Microphone](https://amzn.to/3X8Lom7)

For the price, this thing is pretty great. I didn't want to deal with a whole audio-interface setup, so the fact that this has a bog-standard USB cable is really nice. The audio quality is excellent. This is a fantastic mic for video calls and streaming, but I wouldn't use it for something like a podcast.

#### PC - `heirloom`

This dude is a tank. Named `heirloom` as I'm its third owner, this thing is the ship of theseus. I have it dual booted with Ubuntu and Windows 10. Nowadays it's mainly used to play Hades 2 and Factorio, but I used it to daily drive Ubuntu for a couple years. It has an i5-2500K processor, and a NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970.

##### [Topvision Projector](https://amzn.to/3X3KxDa)

This is my main display for `heirloom`. From the headboard of my bed, it projects out to the entire opposite wall.

##### [Logitech G613 Wireless Keyboard](https://amzn.to/3V7NnV1)

#### Dell Poweredge R710 2U Server - `foundry`

`foundry` is a server mounted in a 42U server rack with a PERC H700 RAID controller. This server does a handful of things:

- Hosts a Jellyfin server for my friends
- Has ~30 TB of RAID 10 NAS storage for backing up footage
- A handful of game servers, tools, and experiments

### Software

##### FreeCAD

FreeCAD is an excellent, open source 3D modeling package, and it's getting better every day. The entire LumenPnP project is modeled in FreeCAD, which makes contributions via git much easier.

I serve as a member of the [FreeCAD Project Association](https://fpa.freecad.org/handbook/people/roster.html).

##### KiCAD

KiCAD is an incredible ECAD program. Fully open source, fully featured, and fun to use.

##### VSCode

Like many others, VSCode is my IDE of choice. With PlatformIO installed, it's fantastic for embedded work and Python scripts alike. I use the [Witchhazel](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TheaFlowers.witch-hazel) theme by the wonderful [Thea Flowers](https://thea.codes/).

##### WireViz

Not a full application, but WireViz is a great command line tool for making cable harness diagrams. It takes a simple YAML file format and converts it to GraphViz, which then renders a beautiful image representing your cable.

##### GIMP

Excellent, easy, and FOSS. I use GIMP for all my image manipulation.

##### Inkscape

I've always had a hard time wrapping my head around working with vectors. I don't use Inkscape for much design work, but mostly for document layout. I primarially make broshures and fliers using Inkscape.

##### Mattermost

Mattermost is what we use for internal company communications at Opulo. All said and done, it was only a few hours to get it installed and running on a DigitalOcean droplet. The Playbook feature has been a really lovely addition to how we operate at the company.

##### Notion

My life is structured using Notion. I use Notion for all my personal note taking, task tracking, and information management. We tried extending it for company use, but it wasn't the right tool for the job. For personal use, it's fantastic.

##### OBS

### Electronics

##### [Weller WE1010NA Soldering Station](https://amzn.to/3KoGr0Y)

This is a good, standard iron. I do wish it got hotter a bit faster, but it's fine for now.

##### [Hakko Omnivice](https://amzn.to/3Vnh9qj)

This is the single most important tool I use for electronics. The Omnivice is a super heavy clamp for holding boards. I cannot fathom working on a PCB without it. It's kind of expensive, but worth its weight in gold.

##### [Hakko Solder Tip Cleaner](https://amzn.to/3yIzKnX)

Brass tip cleaners work much better than a wet sponge, in my experience. It also doesn't drop the temperature of your iron nearly as much!

##### [Kester 0.020" Lead-Free Solder](https://amzn.to/4bN7P52)

You ever use something and just *know* that it's the meta? In college I tried Kester solder for the first time and immediately decided to only ever use that again. I usually use the RoHS-compliant stuff, but sometimes I go with that sweet, sweet [lead](https://amzn.to/45avARN).

##### [SRA 135 Rosin Flux](https://amzn.to/4aI5ozi)

This stuff is really nice. I've tried probably a dozen different kinds of flux, and this one is by *far* my favorite. The jar it comes in is not super practical, so when I buy a new one, I fill up a bunch of [Luer Lock syringes](https://amzn.to/4e5s4Mx) with [dispensing needles](https://amzn.to/4e3arx2) on the end to make it easier to apply.

##### [Solder Wick](https://amzn.to/45ddQ8A)

Similar to the flux, this is the best wick I've found after trying many types. It greatly loses its potency when exposed to air, so I'm careful to keep it inside the packaging until I need it.

##### [Rigol DS1054Z Oscilloscope](https://amzn.to/3yH0fKl)

This is a great starter scope. I've never even gotten close to pushing its limits with my eclectic smattering of needs, but I never really do high-speed stuff. It comes with a lot of decoding features locked, but with a bit of [convincing](https://gotroot.ca/rigol/riglol/) you can get access.

##### [Kaiweets Digital Multimeter](https://amzn.to/3V4j6qq)

meter used to use agilent, now i just use a regular one.

##### [Hantek CC-65 Current Clamp Meter](https://amzn.to/4bF9PMh)

Handy little clamp used for measuring current. Connects right into my Rigol. Takes a 9V battery which I have a tendency to kill when I inevitably forget to switch the clamp off. Converting to a wall wart is on the todo list.

##### [Dr. Meter 30V 5A Adjustable Power Supply](https://amzn.to/3V4g99k)

Great, inexpensive power supply. Does what it says on the tin!

##### [Black Magic Probe](https://1bitsquared.com/products/black-magic-probe)

This is my debugger of choice. It actually runs its own GDB server, so it's incredibly easy to connect to and get going with. It even enumerates with a serial port, so you can debug via SWD/JTAG while also monitoring or sending commands to your target over serial. I have a couple and we use one in every programming jig at Opulo.

##### [Thermal Camera](https://shop.m5stack.com/products/m5stick-t-lite-thermal-camera-dev-kit-mlx90640?variant=43676995322113)

M5 Stack has a cheap little thermal camera module that is super valuable for finding shorts on a board. It even streams the camera feed on the network! Very cool piece of kit.

##### Engineer Brand Hand Tools

Engineer is an incredible little company that just makes really, really good tools. At first I picked up their [PA-09 Crimping Tool](https://amzn.to/3yGo5pN) for making cable harnesses. From there, I've nabbed the [PS-01 Pliers](https://amzn.to/3yQQdX0), [NS-06 Side Cutters](https://amzn.to/3X0hW1J) and (pretty expensive, but worth it) [PTN-03 Titanium Tweezers](https://amzn.to/4aI6QBK). Can't recommend their stuff enough.

##### [Self-Adjusting Wire Strippers](https://amzn.to/4c5Plwl)

These are pretty good, but not *quite* there. The idea is that no matter what wire you put in 'em, it just strips it, perfectly. This happens most of the time, but not always. If you've used something similar that works really well, please [let me know](/contact).

##### [Resistor](https://amzn.to/4bIHm8q) and [Capacitor](https://amzn.to/4c1hQuT) Sample Books

These little dudes are great. Having a sample book on hand means you don't need to buy those annoying 5x quantities of resistors for spinning up a prototype. I pretty much just forget about buying any passives for prototyping, and if one of my values gets low, *then* I'll order some. It's a little kanban system for components!

It helps tremendously if you standardize your designs to a passive size (or just buy a few books in different sizes).

##### [Reflow Oven](https://reflowmasterpro.com/)

I use a Reflow Master Pro to control an off the shelf toaster oven for reflow. I've been using Seon's RMP line for years, and they're fantastic.

### Mechanical

##### [BambuLab P1S 3D Printer](https://us.store.bambulab.com/products/p1s?variant=42153262743688)
