Iâ€™m an engineer and entrepreneur focused on building tools that help bridge the gap between prototyping and mass production.

In April 2021 I founded [Opulo](https://opulo.io/) to help design and build machines that help with mid-scale manufacturing, starting with our flagship product the LumenPnP pick and place machine.

Before that, I worked on a number of projects that I did for fun: a wrist-mounted flamethrower, a light-up bowtie you control over Wifi, full body 3D scanners, or 3D printed prosthetic hands.

Passionate from a young age, I was featured on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and The Martha Stewart Show, all before starting middle school. After graduation, I did work for Deeplocal where I designed and built functional and aesthetic engineering prototypes in timelines as short as nine days for clients such as Google, Lyft, Nest, Android, Netflix, and many others. This included supporting demos and activations all over the world, including India, China, Japan, and the UK.

You can see my projects on my YouTube Channel, and the source for my projects lives on my Github.
